#   See the "stepper" section for a description of the above

nozzle_diameter: 0.8
#   Diameter of the nozzle orifice (in mm). This parameter must be
#   provided.
filament_diameter: 1.75
#   The nominal diameter of the raw filament (in mm) as it enters the
#   extruder. This parameter must be provided.
#max_extrude_cross_section:
#   Maximum area (in mm^2) of an extrusion cross section (eg,
#   extrusion width multiplied by layer height). This setting prevents
#   excessive amounts of extrusion during relatively small XY moves.
#   If a move requests an extrusion rate that would exceed this value
#   it will cause an error to be returned. The default is: 4.0 *
#   nozzle_diameter^2
#instantaneous_corner_velocity: 1.000
#   The maximum instantaneous velocity change (in mm/s) of the
#   extruder during the junction of two moves. The default is 1mm/s.
max_extrude_only_distance: 550.0
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that a retraction or
#   extrude-only move may have. If a retraction or extrude-only move
#   requests a distance greater than this value it will cause an error
#   to be returned. The default is 50mm.
#max_extrude_only_velocity:
#max_extrude_only_accel:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) and acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the
#   extruder motor for retractions and extrude-only moves. These
#   settings do not have any impact on normal printing moves. If not
#   specified then they are calculated to match the limit an XY
#   printing move with a cross section of 4.0*nozzle_diameter^2 would
#   have.
#pressure_advance: 0.0
#   The amount of raw filament to push into the extruder during
#   extruder acceleration. An equal amount of filament is retracted
#   during deceleration. It is measured in millimeters per
#   millimeter/second. The default is 0, which disables pressure
#   advance.
#pressure_advance_smooth_time: 0.040
#   A time range (in seconds) to use when calculating the average
#   extruder velocity for pressure advance. A larger value results in
#   smoother extruder movements. This parameter may not exceed 200ms.
#   This setting only applies if pressure_advance is non-zero. The
#   default is 0.040 (40 milliseconds).
#
# The remaining variables describe the extruder heater.
heater_pin: P2.5 # SKR 1.3 standart P2.7
#   PWM output pin controlling the heater. This parameter must be
#   provided.
max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   heater_pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set
#   fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would
#   allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This
#   setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended
#   periods) to the heater. The default is 1.0.
sensor_type: PT1000
#   Type of sensor - common thermistors are "EPCOS 100K B57560G104F",
#   "ATC Semitec 104GT-2", "ATC Semitec 104NT-4-R025H42G", "Generic
#   3950","Honeywell 100K 135-104LAG-J01", "NTC 100K MGB18-104F39050L32",
#   "SliceEngineering 450", and "TDK NTCG104LH104JT1". See the
#   "Temperature sensors" section for other sensors. This parameter
#   must be provided.
sensor_pin: P0.24
#   Analog input pin connected to the sensor. This parameter must be
#   provided.
pullup_resistor: 4700
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the pullup attached to the thermistor.
#   This parameter is only valid when the sensor is a thermistor. The
#   default is 4700 ohms.
#smooth_time: 1.0
#   A time value (in seconds) over which temperature measurements will
#   be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement noise. The default
#   is 1 seconds.
control = pid
#   Control algorithm (either pid or watermark). This parameter must
#   be provided.
pid_kp = 38.069
pid_ki = 2.488
pid_kd = 145.613
#   The proportional (pid_Kp), integral (pid_Ki), and derivative
#   (pid_Kd) settings for the PID feedback control system. Klipper
#   evaluates the PID settings with the following general formula:
#     heater_pwm = (Kp*error + Ki*integral(error) - Kd*derivative(error)) / 255
#   Where "error" is "requested_temperature - measured_temperature"
#   and "heater_pwm" is the requested heating rate with 0.0 being full
#   off and 1.0 being full on. Consider using the PID_CALIBRATE
#   command to obtain these parameters. The pid_Kp, pid_Ki, and pid_Kd
#   parameters must be provided for PID heaters.
#max_delta: 2.0
#   On 'watermark' controlled heaters this is the number of degrees in
#   Celsius above the target temperature before disabling the heater
#   as well as the number of degrees below the target before
#   re-enabling the heater. The default is 2 degrees Celsius.
#pwm_cycle_time: 0.100
#   Time in seconds for each software PWM cycle of the heater. It is
#   not recommended to set this unless there is an electrical
#   requirement to switch the heater faster than 10 times a second.
#   The default is 0.100 seconds.
min_extrude_temp: 170
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) at which extruder move
#   commands may be issued. The default is 170 Celsius.
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 290
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. This check can help detect some
#   heater and sensor hardware failures. Set this range just wide
#   enough so that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error.
#   These parameters must be provided.

### Extruder¶

#   If the extruder uses gears then it will also be necessary to determine 
#   and set the gear_ratio for the extruder.

#   It's possible to obtain an initial rotation distance for extruders by 
#   measuring the diameter of the "hobbed bolt" that pushes the filament 
#   and using the following 
#   - formula: rotation_distance = <diameter> * 3.14

#   The actual rotation distance on an extruder will vary from printer to printer,
#   because the grip of the "hobbed bolt" that engages the filament can vary. 
#   It can even vary between filament spools. After obtaining an initial rotation_distance, 
#   use the measure and trim procedure to obtain a more accurate setting.

### Using a gear_ratio¶
#   Setting a gear_ratio can make it easier to configure the rotation_distance on steppers 
#   that have a gear box (or similar) attached to it. Most steppers do not have a gear box 
#   - if unsure then do not set gear_ratio in the config.

#   When gear_ratio is set, the rotation_distance represents the distance the axis moves with 
#   one full rotation of the final gear on the gear box. If, for example, one is using a gearbox 
#   with a "5:1" ratio, then one could calculate the rotation_distance with knowledge of the 
#   hardware and then add gear_ratio: 5:1 to the config.

#   For gearing implemented with belts and pulleys, it is possible to determine the gear_ratio 
#   by counting the teeth on the pulleys. For example, if a stepper with a 16 toothed pulley 
#   drives the next pulley with 80 teeth then one would use gear_ratio: 80:16. Indeed, one could 
#   open a common off the shelf "gear box" and count the teeth in it to confirm its gear ratio.

#   Note that sometimes a gearbox will have a slightly different gear ratio than what it is advertised as. 
#   The common BMG extruder motor gears are an example of this - they are advertised as "3:1" but actually 
#   use "50:17" gearing. (Using teeth numbers without a common denominator may improve overall gear wear as 
#   the teeth don't always mesh the same way with each revolution.) The common "5.18:1 planetary gearbox", 
#   is more accurately configured with gear_ratio: 57:11.
